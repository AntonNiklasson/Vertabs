# Vertabs Chrome Extension

## Basic concept
Use this Chrome Extension if you want an easier way of using Chrome with a lot of tabs. Put Chrome in fullscreen mode <code>Shift + Cmd + F</code> or <code>F 11</code>. You will then be able to switch tabs with Vertabs.

Since Chrome Extensions don't have permission to open a new tab with the adress bar (or Omnibox) focused I'll try to find some other way. I'd like the user to simple by able to press "New tab" and then type the url. As for now, they'll have to pull down the original Chrome toolbar and manually click the adress bar and THEN type the url.

## The name "Vertabs"
An abbreviation of "vertical tabs".

## Future features
* Settings like Vertabs position etc.
* Drag 'n drop to reorder tabs
* Pin tabs
