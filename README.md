# Vertabs - Chrome Extension

## Basic concept
This Chrome Extension gives you an easier way of keeping track of all your tabs. Enter fullscreen with <code>Shift + Cmd + F</code> or <code>F 11</code> for the best experience.

## Future features
* Pin tabs from Vertabs
* A few color schemes to choose from. Light, dark, blue etc.
* Write your own CSS to style Vertabs
* Auto-hiding Vertabs when not in fullscreen.
