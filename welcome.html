			<p>Vertabs is an easy to a Chrome Extension for tab junkies. Simple as that.</p>

			<p>The basic idea is to give you vertical tabs to scroll through. You'll be able to read the site title at all times. No matter how many tabs you have open.</p>

			<p>How to get started:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Activate Vertabs in Chromes top right corner.</li>
				<li>Reload any tabs previously open.</li>
				<li>Put your mouse over the thin gray bar which appeared on your left hand side in Chrome.</li>
				<li>Enjoy vertical tabs.</li>
			</ol>

			<p><i><strong>Remember:</strong> Chrome extensions are not allowed in tabs like bookmarks, extensions page and so on. This one included. Vertabs will work in all other tabs.</i></p>
