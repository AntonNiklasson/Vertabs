			<p>Vertabs is an easy to a Chrome Extension for tab junkies. Simple as that.</p>

			<p><i><strong>Remember:</strong> Chrome extensions are not allowed in pages like Chrome bookmarks, the extensions settings page and so on. This one included. Vertabs will work in all other tabs.</i></p>

			<p>The basic idea is to give you vertical tabs to scroll through. You'll be able to read the site title at all times. No matter how many tabs you have open.</p>

			<p>How to get started:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Activate Vertabs in Chromes top right corner.</li>
				<li>Vertabs appears as a thin gray bar on your left hand side. Hover it to reveal the tab list.</li>
				<li>Close this, and ENJOY VERTICAL TABS.</li>
			</ol>
